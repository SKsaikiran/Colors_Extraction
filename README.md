# Color Percentage Segregation and Analysis with OpenCV and Matplotlib

**This Jupyter notebook contains Python code that uses the OpenCV and Matplotlib libraries to extract the percentage of colors and segregate them for a single input image using image processing. It also displays the color names and their percentages with bar graph and highlighted highest color point as output.**
